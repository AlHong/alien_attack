# alien attack

A game similar to Space Invaders that uses the Pygame module.

Controls:
<br>
left arrow - move left
<br>
right arrow - move right
<br>
spacebar - shoot
<br>
q - quit game
<br>
What I Learned:
- the Pygame module
- how to implement concepts in game development (moving objects, collision detection)
